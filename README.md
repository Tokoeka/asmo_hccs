# Asmo-HCCS

This is a hardcore community service script made by me Asmodais (#2071543), frankensteined together from similar scripts by Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124) & Manendra (#1483803) It is designed to work if you are me, Asmodais (#2071543) - but that is not yet guaranteed.

If you aren't me, it may not work for you! It assumes you own a lot of things, and that you're whitelisted to `Alliance From Heck` and `Hobopolis Vacation Home`. For players not blessed with a whitelist to those clans, set the properties `phccs_mainClan` and `phccs_elfClan` to a clan that has a full VIP room, and a clan that has an available Mother Slime, respectively. It will also expect you to have a CCS named `twiddle`, which should consist of the single line `scrollwhendone`.

At present, PHCCS requires the following iotms/expensive old items to operate:
 * Peppermint Garden
 * Little Geneticist DNA-Splicing Lab
 * Chateau (with a Black Crayon Crimbo Elf in the painting, but it should be set to ceiling fan/foreign language tapes/juice bar)
 * Volcano
 * Mumming Trunk
 * Camel
 * Stocking Mimic
 * Sweet Synthesis
 * VIP Key
 * Short Order Cook

 * Barrel Shrine
 * Lovebugs
 * Sorcerers of the Shore Grimoire
 * Clip-Art
 * Sugar Sheets
 * Candles
 * Numberology
 * Deck
 * Ghosts

 * Industrial Fire Extinguisher
 
 It also really appreciates it if you have:
  * Disembodied Hand
  * Mini-Adventurer
