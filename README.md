# Asmo-HCCS

This is a hardcore community service script made by me Asmodais (#2071543), frankensteined together from similar scripts by Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124) & Manendra (#1483803). It is designed to work if you are me, Asmodais (#2071543) - but even that is not yet guaranteed.

Asmo-HCCS currently requires you to be a Pastamancer ascended under the Wallaby Moonsign, with Astral Pilsners, with a Peppermint Garden in your campground and a DNA Lab in your workshed. 

Even in that case, if you aren't me, it may not work for you! It assumes you own a lot of things, and that you're whitelisted to `Alliance From Heck` and `Hobopolis Vacation Home`. For players not blessed with a whitelist to those clans, set the properties `asmocs_mainClan` to a clan that has a full VIP room, `asmocs_fishClan` to the clan you are happy to use the Floundry of, and `asmocs_elfClan` toa clan that has an available Mother Slime. It will also expect you to have a CCS named `twiddle`, which should consist of the single line `scrollwhendone`.

At present, Asmo-HCCS requires the following iotms/expensive old items/skills to operate:
 * Peppermint Garden
 * Little Geneticist DNA-Splicing Lab
 * Chateau (Does not use the painting, but otherwise set to ceiling fan/foreign language tapes/juice bar)
